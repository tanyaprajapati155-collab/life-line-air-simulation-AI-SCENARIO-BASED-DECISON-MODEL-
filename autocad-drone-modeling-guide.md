## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 3D Modeling Problems
1. **Objects not joining**: Check for gaps, use AUDIT command
2. **Rendering issues**: Verify normals, check lighting
3. **Performance problems**: Use PURGE, reduce polygon count
4. **Assembly conflicts**: Check interference with INTERFERE command

### Best Practices
1. **Work in consistent units** (millimeters recommended)
2. **Use appropriate precision** for components
3. **Maintain backup files** regularly
4. **Document modeling decisions** for future reference
5. **Test assembly fit** before finalizing components

## Validation and Testing

### Design Verification
1. **Weight calculation**: Use MASSPROP command
2. **Center of gravity**: Calculate using MASSPROP
3. **Interference checking**: Use INTERFERE command
4. **Dimensional verification**: Use MEASUREGEOM

### Performance Analysis Integration
1. **Export to CFD software**: Save as STEP or IGES
2. **Structural analysis**: Export for FEA software
3. **3D printing preparation**: Export as STL for prototyping
4. **Manufacturing drawings**: Generate detailed 2D drawings
